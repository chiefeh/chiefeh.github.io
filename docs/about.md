# Who Am I

## Background

I've worked as a technologist for 20 years, mostly fixing problems or building
new systems in the classic sense of plugging firewalls into internet connections,
building windows servers, desktops and laptops and then supporting people
using those computers.

> Mostly I've been learning from other people's mistakes.

## What is this site for

Its about time I started doing what I normally only get to talk about.
So this site is hosted on git hub sites, using MKDocs and Materials theme.
