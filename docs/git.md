# Git and all related things.

The products & services in the title are key to so many organisations. I will focus
on learning GitHub's services and features as much as possible, but also compare
to alternates such as GitLab and I have an account there too. I will try
to compare/contrast where necessary for my own benefit and share here.

I've decided to pay for a "Pro" GitHub Account - just because, I've also decided
to sponsor [Jeff Geerling](https://github.com/geerlingguy) as I read a lot of his
material and watch his awesome videos on YouTube. Top bloke.

Got a shout out!
