# Welcome to Chiefeh's Blog

I've decided to start recording my technology things so I can reference them
in future when I forget things and for the benefit of others who are in a
similar position. I've chosen ReadTheDocs as the way to convert MarkDown 
files into nice to look at websites. See the about section to see how I built
this.

First up is Infrastructure as code (IaC). This will depend on Terraform, Ansible,
containers and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) to build the
Infrastructure that will run applications. I am not a developer so a lot of this
will be new to me, along with figuring out some new apps such as Atom.io,
Git/GitHub and so on.
