# Infrastructure as code (IaC)

So IaC is going to be a huge part of my career for this decade. I do like
visiting data centres but I do not want to spend weeks racking 'n stacking
things anymore without good reason. In a work context its now much more acceptable
to use the 'cloud' to do these things.
